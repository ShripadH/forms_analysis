### **Analysis & Proposal: Migrating from Flowable Forms to an Open-Source Solution**

**Date:** [Date]
**Prepared For:** Senior Management
**Subject:** A future-proof, cost-effective strategy for our form infrastructure post-Flowable Enterprise.

### **Executive Summary**

This document outlines a strategy to address the upcoming non-renewal of our Flowable Enterprise license. Our current library of forms, defined in Flowable's proprietary JSON format, will become unusable without the licensed software, posing a significant risk to business processes that rely on them.

We propose a one-time migration of our existing form definitions to a modern, open-source standard. The recommended solution is to adopt the **`formio.js` open-source library**, which provides a complete ecosystem for building, rendering, and managing forms.

This approach will not only ensure **100% backward compatibility** for our existing forms but will also **eliminate licensing costs**, prevent future vendor lock-in, and provide a powerful, highly customizable platform that can be securely hosted within our own intranet. The estimated effort is a one-time development project to script the migration, with significant long-term benefits in cost, control, and flexibility.

### **1. Problem Statement**

With the decision to not renew the Flowable Enterprise license, we face a critical issue:

- We possess a valuable asset: a large number of business-critical forms defined as Flowable Page Model JSON files.
- This JSON schema is proprietary and requires the licensed Flowable rendering engine to display, edit, or use.
- Upon license expiration, all existing forms will become inoperable, requiring a complete, manual rebuild of every form, leading to significant cost, time investment, and potential disruption to business operations.

### **2. Core Objective**

Our goal is to find a solution that allows us to:

1.  **Preserve our investment** by salvaging our existing form definitions.
2.  **Ensure backward compatibility** so that forms can still be rendered and submitted.
3.  **Establish a future-proof platform** for creating and editing forms.
4.  **Eliminate recurring license costs** and avoid vendor lock-in.
5.  **Maintain full control and security** by hosting the entire solution on our internal network (intranet).

### **3. Analysis of Open-Source Form Solutions**

We analyzed several leading open-source solutions that provide a form schema, a visual editor (builder), and a rendering engine. The `formio.js` library emerged as the strongest candidate.

**Comparison of Leading Open-Source Form Ecosystems:**

| Feature              | form.io (`formio.js`)                                                                                                     | SurveyJS                                                                           | JSON Forms                                                                        |

| **Visual Editor**    | **Excellent & Free (MIT License)**                                                                                        | Excellent, but **Paid Commercial License Required**                                | No mature, official editor                                                        |

| **Best For**         | Organizations seeking a powerful, all-in-one, no-cost form solution with full ownership.                                  | Projects where a superior UI is critical and the editor license fee is acceptable. | Programmatic form generation where a visual builder is not a primary requirement. |
| **Recommendation**   | **Highly Recommended**                                                                                                    | **Not Recommended** (due to editor cost)                                           | **Not Recommended** (due to lack of editor)                                       |

### **4. Proposed Solution: `formio.js`**

We recommend adopting the free, MIT-licensed `formio.js` library. It is crucial to distinguish this from the _paid Form.io commercial platform_. We will only use the free library and build our own backend.

**How the `formio.js` Free Version Helps Us:**

- **Form Builder:** It provides a powerful, visual, drag-and-drop editor that we can embed in our own internal web application.
- **Form Renderer:** It can take a form JSON and render a fully interactive and functional HTML form.
- **JSON Schema:** It uses a well-defined JSON format that can support all our existing form complexities, including layouts, validation, and conditional logic.

This means we get all the necessary front-end tools completely free of charge. Our only cost is the internal development effort to host it and build the necessary backend APIs.

### **5. Implementation and Integration Strategy**

#### **5.1. The Migration Path: Converting Flowable JSON**

The migration from Flowable JSON to `formio.js` JSON is a medium-complexity task achievable via a one-time script.

- **Process:** We will develop a script (e.g., in Node.js or Python) that reads each Flowable JSON file, transforms it according to a defined mapping, and saves the new `formio.js` JSON file.
- **Tools:** Open-source tools like `jq`, `JSONata`, or native language features can be used to perform the mapping.
- **Expression Buttons:** Complex logic like Flowable's "outcome" buttons can be cleanly migrated. The standard pattern in `formio.js` is to use a hidden field to store the outcome ('approved', 'rejected') and have buttons that set the value of this field before a final "Submit" button is clicked.

#### **5.2. Secure Intranet Deployment**

We can host the `formio.js` builder and renderer securely within our intranet, ensuring no data is ever exposed to the public internet.

- **Architecture:** The solution consists of two parts:
  1.  **Frontend App (on ECS):** A lightweight containerized web application that serves the Form Builder UI. This will be placed in a **private VPC subnet** and accessed via an **internal Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.
  2.  **Backend API & DB (Our Control):** Our internal team will manage the API and database to save/load form definitions and submissions. These will also reside in the private VPC.
- **Result:** The entire system is firewalled from the internet. Users access the form builder via an internal URL, and all data communication happens exclusively within our secure network.

#### **5.3. Integration with Corporate Design System (Custom CSS)**

The solution provides full support for our organization's mandated design system and styling.

- **Requirement:** All form controls (text fields, buttons, etc.) must match our corporate branding.
- **Solution:** `formio.js` offers multiple ways to apply custom CSS. The recommended and most robust method is using the **`customClass` property**. We can assign our design system's classes (e.g., `.ds-input`, `.ds-button-primary`) directly to form components in the JSON definition, ensuring perfect and maintainable style alignment.

#### **5.4. Advanced Extensibility (Custom React Components)**

For unique requirements not covered by standard controls, we can integrate our own custom React components.

- **Requirement:** Ability to use specialized, internally-developed React components (e.g., an interactive chart, a custom address lookup) within a form.
- **Solution:** While an advanced feature, this is fully supported. It involves creating a JavaScript "bridge" that allows `formio.js` to render a placeholder element and then uses `ReactDOM` to mount our custom React component into that element. This gives us unlimited flexibility to extend the platform to meet any future business need.
